          <p>People don't think in paragraphs. Thinktool lets you write down
          what you're thinking in the way you're thinking it.</p>
          <p>Start by writing down everything as a series of bullet points. Then
          you can <a href="#">add connections between different items</a>,
          organize them into hierarchies and even <a href="#">define complex
          relationships</a> between them.</p>
          <!-- TODO: Some kind of video demonstrating this concept. -->
          <p>Then, explore. You can see your ideas laid out in a hierarchy, jump
          from one thought to the next, or <a href="#">create a custom view</a>
          to see your ideas in the way that is the most useful to you.</p>
          <p>In the process of transforming knowledge from a static chunk of
          text into a detailed, interactive system of individual ideas, you will
          gain a deeper understanding of what you already know.</p>
