          <h1>Explore the connections between your ideas.</h1>
          <p>People don't think in paragraphs.</p>

          <p>Thinktool is an alternative to note-taking tools and outliners like
          <a href="https://evernote.com/" class="external-app-link">Evernote</a>
          and <a href="https://workflowy.com/" class="external-app-link">Workflowy</a>
          that works in a different way.</p>

          <p>Thinktool looks like an outliner, but underneath it structures your
          items like a graph. Rather than arranging items in a tree, you connect
          related items to each other. If you want to, you can then structure
          those items into loose hierarchies, but the same item may be in
          multiple places and items can even be their own parents. This model
          gives you the freedom to write down your ideas in the same way they
          are structured in your mind.</p>

          <p>I'm currently working on developing Thinktool. However, you can try
          it out right now, by <a href="/login" class="call-to-action">signing
          up</a>. Please be aware that Thinktool is very unstable, and since the
          current preview is only intended for testing, <strong
          class="warning">your data may be deleted at any time</strong>.</p>

      <div class="section" id="similar-tools">
        <section>
          <h1>Alternatives to Thinktool.</h1>
          <p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" class="external-app-link">Roam</a>
          is a fairly new app that does many of the same things as Thinktool,
          but which does most of them better. I'd recommend checking it out!</p>

          <p>Thinktool is directly inspired by outliners like
          <a href="https://orgmode.org/" class="external-app-link">Org mode</a>,
          <a href="https://workflowy.com/" class="external-app-link">Workflowy</a> and
          <a href="https://dynalist.io/" class="external-app-link">Dynalist</a>,
          though Thinktool uses a more powerful data model underneath.</p>

          <p>Thinktool stores its data in a similar way to
          <a href="https://thebrain.com/"
          class="external-app-link">TheBrain</a>, but wheraas Thinktool presents
          its data like a tree, TheBrain tries to look more like a mind-mapping
          tool.</p>
