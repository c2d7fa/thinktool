    <h1>How to take notes with Thinktool</h1>
    <p>
      There are many ways to take notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinktool is an associative note-taking application designed to hold an evolving library of notes. You may be used
      to taking notes once, and then throwing those notes away. In contrast, Thinktool is designed for notes that
      continually change, grow, and improve as you learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Thinktool, you grow your library by building connections between different notes. The smallest element that you
      can link to is simply called an <i>item</i>. It looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial1.png" width="587" height="68" />
    <p>
      An item can represent a topic, a note, a person, an object, or anything else that you may want to write about.
      Items should be as small as possible to make your links as specific as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new item by clicking the <i class="button">New</i> button on the toolbar. Then, write some notes that you
      want to keep in your library.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you're writing, press <kbd>Alt+L</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> on macOS) to insert links to any important
      concepts or words. (We'll come back to links in a bit.) Links are showed with a bullet next to them.
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial2.png" width="588" height="113" />
    <p>
      Links are the most general way to structure notes, but they're not the only way. Sometimes, an item may fit better
      <em>inside</em> another item. Try to organize your notes into a tree with the <i class="button">Unindent</i>, <i
        class="button">Indent</i>, <i class="button">Up</i> and <i class="button">Down</i> buttons on the toolbar.
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial3.png" width="604" height="168" />
    <p>
      Did you create some links? Try to click on the bullet next to a link, and notice how the linked item is opened
      underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Thinktool, links are <em>bidirectional</em>. This means that everytime you link to an item, Thinktool
      automatically adds a reference in the other direction. You can find all the references to an item under
      <i>References</i> inside the linked item.
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial4.png" width="562" height="198" />
    <p>
      One of the unique features of Thinktool is that you're not limited to organizing notes in a strict hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, links let you freely connect different notes together, like in other tools such as <a
        href="https://roamresearch.com/" rel="nofollow"><span>Roam Research</span></a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/"
        rel="nofollow"><span>Obsidian</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Thinktool goes one step further, by allowing each note to have multiple parents. This lets you freely
      build up a "loose hierarchy" of notes, without needing to worry about where each individual note belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make use of this feature, <i class="toolbar-heading">connect</i> two existing items. You can do this with the
      <i class="button">Sibling</i>, <i class="button">Child</i> or <i class="button">Parent</i> buttons in the toolbar.
      Start typing the content of an existing item, and then select that item in the popup.
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial5.png" width="610" height="345" />
    <p>
      In the same way that Thinktool automatically collects all references to a given item, it will also show you all
      the parents of an item.
    </p>
    <img src="tutorial6.png" width="611" height="207" />
    <p>
      When thinking about where to put a item, ask yourself this: <em>In which context would I want to be reminded of
        this item?</em> Put your items where you want to see them. Since Thinktool has bidirectcional links, creating a
      link between two items means that you will be reminded of one item when looking at the other and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of taking notes isn't to have a complete repository of all possible knowledge. That already exists, and
      it's called Google. The point of note-taking is to build a curated library of information that is relevant to you,
      expressed in a way that makes sense to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to achieve this, it's critical that you regularly revisit your notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be going back and getting rid of notes or connections that are no longer relevant. Use <i
        class="button">Remove</i> to remove an item from its parent, and use <i class="button">Destroy</i> to
      permanently delete that item from the database, removing it from all of its parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking notes is the process of turning abstract thoughts into a tangible product. It's like writing, but more
      personal. This is not a trivial task, and you need to put in real effort over a long period of time to get good
      notes.
