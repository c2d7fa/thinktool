        <h1>An outliner without the hierarchy.</h1>

        <p>Outliners are great for taking notes, but they have one problem:
        people don't think in lists. Thinktool looks like an outliner but lets
        you freely connect related items without worrying about how to organize
        them in a hierarchy.</p>

              <h1>Explore your knowledge.</h1>
              <p>Thinktool lets you link related items together so you can easily
              jump between them. And if an item is a member of multiple
              categories, it can automatically show you all the related
              items.</p>

              <p>One item can be in multiple places at once. Use this feature to
              accurately categorize items, so you can easily find the information
              you need.</p>

              <p>With the table view, you can easily summarize structured
              information. The table columns are automatically created based on
              relationships between items.</p>

          <h1>Try it.</h1>
          <p>I'm currently developing Thinktool. Therefore, it's quite
          unstable, and the current preview is mainly intended for testing.</p>
          <p>That being said, you can check it out now, and if you like it, you
          can <a href="/login.html"><span>sign up</span></a> for an account.
          The preview is currently free, but Thinktool may become a paid
          subscription service in the future. Click the button below to check
          out a free demo in your browser:</p> <a href="/demo.html"

          <h1>Alternatives to Thinktool.</h1>

          <p>Thinktool is directly inspired by outliners like
          <a href="https://orgmode.org/" rel="nofollow" class="external-app-link"><span>Org mode</span></a>,
          <a href="https://workflowy.com/" rel="nofollow" class="external-app-link"><span>Workflowy</span></a> and
          <a href="https://dynalist.io/" rel="nofollow" class="external-app-link"><span>Dynalist</span></a>,
          but Thinktool uses a more powerful data model underneath.</p>

          <p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" rel="nofollow"
          class="external-app-link"><span>Roam</span></a> is another unusual
          outliner that tries to solve the same problems as Thinktool but takes
          a different approach.</p>

          <p>Thinktool structures your data in a similar way to <a
          href="https://thebrain.com/"
          class="external-app-link"><span>TheBrain</span></a>, but while
          Thinktool looks like an outliner, TheBrain looks like a mind-map.</p>
