      <h1>Thinktool Newsletter for May 2020</h1>
      <p>
        Thank you for signing up for this roughly monthly newsletter for
        <a href="https://thinktool.io/">Thinktool</a>, an associative note-taking app designed to help you
        understand complex topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been working on Thinktool for a couple of months now. While still unpolished, I think it's coming
        along nicely, if I say so myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading your feedback has been the highlight of this project so far for me. Although I've been
        programming since I was in my teens, this is my first attempt at making something for other people, by
        myself. Actually putting it out there is exciting — and a little bit scary!
      </p>

      <h3>How I'm working on Thinktool</h3>

      <p>
        Although I would love to see Thinktool eventually become profitable, it's currently just a
        side-project that I'm spending 5-20 hours a week on. That's not much time, so I'm carefully
        prioritizing tasks. Feedback helps me figure out what's important and what's not. If Thinktool looks
        like something that'll eventually be useful to you, you should make sure to send me your feedback, so
        I can focus on the parts that are important to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought it might be fun to let you have a look at what I'm currently doing, so I've now made my task
        list public. If you want to stay updated on what's next for Thinktool, you can now spy on me here:

      <h3>An offline app?</h3>

      <p>
        I originally planned for Thinktool to be available only as a web app. However, I've gotten a lot of
        feedback from people that want to have their notes available offline. Given how important my notes are
        to me, I can certainly empathize with this view. In fact, an offline app is something that I would use
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I'm looking into creating an offline desktop app for Thinktool.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is technically quite challenging, so I've decided to do it in phases. Phase one will be to have a
        basic prototype that can do everything that the online version can do, but which saves to a local
        file. I am planning on adding login, synchronization, automatic updates, etc., etc. later on.
      </p>

      <h3>Export to Roam</h3>

      <p>
        I'm also working on other features at the same time as the offline app. One cool feature that I
        recently added is the ability to export all your notes to Roam Research. If you're worried about
        Thinktool disappearing, I hope this feature will give you some peace of mind.
