      <h1>Taking better notes with principles from the Zettelkasten method</h1>

        The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann published over 70 books in his lifetime. He was highly
        influential, not only in sociology, but also in philosophy and systems theory.
      </p>
      <p>How was he so productive?</p>
      <p>
        Luhmann took an absurdly large number of small notes. Throughout his almost his entire life, he would
        constantly be writing down ideas on index cards, and organizing them in his
        <i>Zettelkasten</i> &ndash; "slip box". When he died at the age of 70 in 1998, he left behind him some
        90,000 such notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizing such a massive catalouge of notes is no easy feat, yet Luhmann managed to do it.

        In this article, I'll show you 3 principles that you can use to build your own note-taking system from
        scratch.
      </p>
      <h2>1 &ndash; Each note should fit on an index card.</h2>
      <p>
        You don't actually have to <em>use</em> index cards, of course, but even if you're using a modern
        note-taking app, make your notes as small as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each note should contain exactly one idea. If you can't explain an idea on an index card, then you
        probably don't really understand it. The purpose of note-taking isn't to store every single piece of
        information out there; rather, note-taking is a system for turning information into knowledge. By
        splitting your notes into pieces that are as small as psosible, you force yourself to boil each idea
        down to its core.
      </p>

        For example, here's a screenshot of some of my notes about this topic:
      </p>
      <img src="atomic.png" width="764" height="380" />
      <p>
        Each note is a few sentences at most. It took a while getting my notes this concise, but in the
        process I gained a better understanding of the topic.
