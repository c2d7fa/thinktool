      <h1>Taking better notes with principles from the Zettelkasten method</h1>

        The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann published over 70 books in his lifetime. He was highly
        influential, not only in sociology, but also in philosophy and systems theory.
      </p>
      <p>How was he so productive?</p>
      <p>
        Luhmann took an absurdly large number of small notes. Throughout his almost his entire life, he would
        constantly be writing down ideas on index cards, and organizing them in his
        <i>Zettelkasten</i> &ndash; "slip box". When he died at the age of 70 in 1998, he left behind him some
        90,000 such notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizing such a massive catalouge of notes is no easy feat, yet Luhmann managed to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article, I'll show you 3 principles that you can use to build your own note-taking system from
        scratch.
      </p>
      <h2>1 &ndash; Each note should fit on an index card.</h2>
      <p>
        You don't actually have to <em>use</em> index cards, of course, but even if you're using a modern
        note-taking app, make your notes as small as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each note should contain exactly one idea. If you can't explain an idea on an index card, then you
        probably don't really understand it. The purpose of note-taking isn't to store every single piece of
        information out there; rather, note-taking is a system for turning information into knowledge. By
        splitting your notes into pieces that are as small as psosible, you force yourself to boil each idea
        down to its core.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, here's a screenshot of some of my notes about this topic:
      </p>
      <img src="atomic.png" width="764" height="380" />
      <p>
        Each note is a few sentences at most. It took a while getting my notes this concise, but in the
        process I gained a better understanding of the topic.
      </p>

      <h2>2 &ndash; Your notes should be tightly connected.</h2>
      <p>
        Zettelkasten isn't just a storage system. Luhmann wrote about his Zettelkasten that he considered it a
        kind of conversation partner. It's an interactive system. It has the ability to surprise or challenge,
        it has ideas of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magic is <em>linking</em>. Each note should be linked to all the notes and concepts that it's
        related to. Then, you can look up any note, and your Zettelkasten will tell you about other notes that
        you may have totally forgotten. By exploring your notes like this, you can stumble across connections
        that you had never even made yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luhmann would painstakingly add references to all his index cards, but if you're using a modern
        note-taking app with support for bidirectional links &ndash; such as
        <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" rel="nofollow"><span>Roam Research</span></a
        >, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" rel="nofollow"><span>Obsidian</span></a> or
        <a href="/"><span>Thinktool</span></a> &ndash; adding links is effortless.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I have a note about how to add structure to your Zettelkasten (more about that in a bit).
        I can see that this note is linked to a bunch of concepts, and I can open up those concepts to see
        where else they are mentioned:
      </p>
      <img src="interconnected.png" width="757" height="735" />
      <p>
        (For simplicity, I'm showing an example where there's only two references, but imagine how you may
        stumble across dozens of related notes in this way.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All I had to do was add a link to a particular concept. Then, all of the other notes that also links
        to that concept can be opened in a single click. Since our notes are so concise, I can quickly read
        through these notes to see if there are any new connections here that I hadn't thought of before.
      </p>

      <h2>3 &ndash; Let your notes organize themselves.</h2>
      <p>
        With 90,000 notes, all written out by hand on paper, surely Luhmann must have had an extremely complex
        system for indexing his notes, right? Well, not exactly. Luhmann never sat down and devised a system
        for his notes. He just sat down and wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're tempted to come up with a system for organizing all your notes &ndash; stop!. This is a
        terrible idea. The entire point of linking your notes together with bidirectional links is that you
        <em>don't need</em> tags, hierarchies, or whatever other system you were going to come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        That certainly isn't to say that Luhmann <em>didn't</em> organize his notes. But he let his systems
        for organizing notes grow with the notes themselves. Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you're exploring your notes, you will stumble across new connections that you didn't know about
        before. When that happens, <em>just add another note</em>. If the connection isn't obvious, you should
        explain it in your new note, and add links to existing notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you may want to organize a bunch of notes in a single place, so you can easily find all
        notes related to that topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        One problem that traditional outliners and note-taking apps have is that each note must be in one
        place. However, apps like <a href="/"><span>Thinktool</span></a> and
        <a href="https://www.thebrain.com/" rel="nofollow"><span>TheBrain</span></a> solve this problem by
        simply letting you put each note in multiple places. For example, one of these notes is both realted
        to Zettelkasten specifically and note-taking in general:
      </p>
      <img src="structure.png" width="812" height="377" />
      <p>
        But really, the main takeaway is this: Just don't worry about it. Your note-taking system doesn't need
        to be perfect from day one. As long as you take brief notes and link them to eachother, I can almost
        guarantee that these notes will be useful to you.
