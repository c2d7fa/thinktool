    <h1>Thinktool Newsletter for October 2020</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Published <time datetime="2020-10-30">October 30th, 2020</time>.</div>

    <p>
      Hey everyone, and welcome to the newsletter for <a href="/"><span>Thinktool</span></a>. In case you've forgotten,
      Thinktool is an associative note-taking app. It uses bidirectional links and multiple parents to represent a graph
      of notes as a seamless outline.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been trying to send these newsletters out roughly once a month. The last one was in July. Oops. But hey, I've
      actually made some good progress on Thinktool &ndash; I just haven't really been writing about it.
    </p>

    <h2>Thinking should be fun</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="/blog/newsletter-july-2020.html"><span>In the last newsletter</span></a>, I wrote that I wanted to focus
      on making Thinktool easier to learn and more pleasant to use. I want to make thinking fun: It should feel good to
      write your ideas down in Thinktool and use its features to connect them with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      To achieve this, I've been focusing hard on reducing friction in the user interface. This comes down to making
      lots of tiny improvements that add up to a more polished experience overall. Here are a some of the improvements
      I've made since last time:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>When you wanted to edit an item, you previously had to click twice; now you can just click on an item and
        start typing - as you would expect.</li>
      <li>There was a bug where inserting a link with would unfocus the item so you had to click it again. Inserting
        links now also works as expected.</li>
      <li>Links to other items would be displayed as special codes (like <code>#q9nsqefl</code>) when editing an item;
        now they're displayed nicely in-line.</li>
      <li>I added basic fuzzy search, so you don't have to remember the exact title of an item that you want to link or
        add as a child.</li>
      <li>The layout of parents and references in the outline have been changed, so they're hopefully more intuitive.
        For example, other parents are now displayed in a little box above the item, and the different connection types
        (like parents and references) have unique bullet graphics.
      <li>Overhauled the typography and added icons.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also mentioned in the last newsletter that I wanted to focus on the tutorial and documentation. This is
      something that I still haven't gotten around to, but it's among the things I'm working on now. Thanks to the
      people who've sent their feedback about the current tutorial!
    </p>

    <h2>Now on Reddit and GitHub</h2>

    <p>
      Thinktool now has <a href="https://reddit.com/r/thinktool"><span>its own subreddit</span></a>. It's pretty sparse
      for now, but if you post a question there I'll do my best to respond.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've also decided to make the <a href="https://github.com/c2d7fa/thinktool"><span>source code for Thinktool
          available on GitHub</span></a>. To be clear, Thinktool isn't actually open source yet. However, I plan to make
      Thinktool properly open source in the future, so you can run your own instance or even develop it yourself if I
      stopped working on it.
